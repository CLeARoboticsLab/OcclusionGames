# Occlusion-Aware Game-theoretic Motion Planning Algorithms

A repository for the OcclusionGames project.

## Description
This repo includes the Jax implementation of an occlusion-aware motion planning algorithm for autonomous driving, powered by an iterated linear-quadratic regulator operating on a hybrid-information game. Learn more here [TODO: insert link to paper]
